# Sudoku Web App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Successfully apply the complete BMAD methodology (brainstorming, planning, development, deployment) to create a functional web application
- Build a self-contained, client-side Sudoku game with algorithmic puzzle generation, real-time validation, and solution verification
- Deploy the application at zero cost on static hosting infrastructure
- Deliver a clean, distraction-free user experience for casual Sudoku players
- Demonstrate disciplined scope management by completing all core features without scope creep
- Create well-structured, maintainable code that serves as a reference for future BMAD-based projects

### Background Context

This project emerged from a structured brainstorming session using First Principles Thinking and SCAMPER methodology to identify the essential requirements for a Sudoku web application. The project serves dual purposes: as an educational vehicle for learning the BMAD method through practical application, and as a functional puzzle game for casual players seeking a simple, ad-free experience.

The key insight from the planning phase was that a complete Sudoku application requires only five fundamental capabilities: displaying a 9x9 grid, accepting user input, validating against Sudoku rules, generating puzzles algorithmically, and verifying solutions. By constraining scope to these essentials and deliberately excluding common features (hints, timers, difficulty selection, social features), the project remains achievable within a learning timeline while still delivering complete functionality.

The technical approach emphasizes simplicity and self-containment: pure vanilla JavaScript with no framework dependencies, client-side only architecture with no backend services, and static hosting deployment. This eliminates cost barriers and infrastructure complexity while focusing learning on fundamentals.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, focused, and free of distractions. Upon loading the application, users immediately see a Sudoku puzzle ready to play—no splash screens, no tutorial overlays, no registration walls. The interface prioritizes the puzzle grid as the central focus, with minimal surrounding controls (just a "New Puzzle" button and potentially a "Check Solution" button).

Visual feedback is immediate and intuitive: clicking a cell clearly shows it's selected, invalid entries turn red instantly, and successfully solving the puzzle provides clear positive confirmation. The design philosophy is "invisible interface"—users should focus on the puzzle, not figuring out how to use the app.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Direct Manipulation**: Click/tap cells directly to select them, type numbers directly on keyboard
- **Immediate Feedback**: Validation happens in real-time as users enter numbers, not on form submission
- **Forgiving Input**: Users can freely change their entries; the app flags errors but doesn't prevent them (educational approach)
- **Minimal Controls**: Primary action is "New Puzzle"; solution verification may be automatic on completion or via explicit button

### Core Screens and Views

**Single Game Screen**: The entire application consists of one primary view containing:
- The 9x9 Sudoku grid (central focus)
- New Puzzle button
- Optional: Check Solution button (if not automatic)
- Optional: Simple status indicator (e.g., "Solving..." or "Solved!")

No additional screens, navigation, menus, or modal dialogs are required for MVP.

### Accessibility

**None** - Accessibility features (keyboard navigation beyond basic number entry, screen reader support, high contrast modes) are explicitly out of scope for MVP. These may be added in post-MVP phases.

### Branding

**Minimal/None** - The application should have a clean, simple aesthetic with good typography and clear visual hierarchy. No specific brand identity, logos, or color schemes are required beyond functional design (e.g., red for errors, distinct styling for given clues vs. user entries, clear grid borders for 3x3 boxes).

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Primary target is desktop browsers, but the application should be functional (though not necessarily optimized) on mobile browsers. The design should adapt reasonably to different viewport sizes without requiring separate mobile-specific implementations. Touch interactions (tapping cells) should work alongside mouse clicks.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing all application code, assets, and documentation. Given the small scope, a simple flat or shallow folder structure is appropriate:
- `/index.html` - Main entry point
- `/styles/` - CSS files
- `/scripts/` - JavaScript modules
- `/docs/` - Project documentation (brief, PRD, brainstorming results)

No build tooling, package managers, or complex repository structure is necessary for MVP.

### Service Architecture

**Client-Side Monolith** - The entire application runs in the browser with no server-side components. JavaScript code is organized into logical modules (data/state management, validation logic, puzzle generation algorithms, UI rendering/interaction) but deployed as a cohesive client-side application.

No backend services, APIs, databases, or serverless functions are required. The architecture is intentionally simple to support zero-cost static hosting and eliminate deployment complexity.

### Testing Requirements

**Manual Testing** - For MVP, testing will be manual and exploratory. The developer will verify each requirement and user flow by directly interacting with the application during development.

**Rationale**: Given the educational nature of the project and limited scope, investing in automated test infrastructure (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests) is not warranted for MVP. The focus is on completing functional features and deploying a working application.

**Post-MVP**: If the project continues beyond MVP, unit tests for the validation and generation algorithms would be valuable additions.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Use modern JavaScript features (modules, arrow functions, const/let, template literals, etc.) assuming browser support for ES6 and beyond
- **CSS Grid for Layout**: Use CSS Grid for the 9x9 Sudoku grid layout, leveraging native browser layout capabilities
- **No Build Process Initially**: Deploy raw HTML/CSS/JS files directly without transpilation, bundling, or minification for MVP simplicity
- **Puzzle Generation Algorithm**: Implement backtracking-based puzzle generation; start with a solved grid (generated via backtracking with random cell ordering) and remove numbers while ensuring unique solvability
- **Unique Solution Verification**: Implement a basic solver to verify puzzles have unique solutions; this is necessary to ensure quality puzzles
- **State Management**: Use simple JavaScript objects/arrays to track game state; no state management library needed
- **Code Organization**: Use ES6 modules (import/export) to organize code into logical units, but keep the module structure simple and flat
- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for puzzle generation failures (e.g., if generation times out, retry or use fallback puzzle)
- **Performance Considerations**: If puzzle generation is slow, consider generating puzzles in the background using Web Workers (post-MVP optimization if needed)

## Epic List

### Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Game Loop

**Goal**: Establish project repository, basic HTML/CSS structure, and implement the core Sudoku gameplay loop with hardcoded puzzles. By the end of this epic, users can play a complete Sudoku game with manual validation, demonstrating all essential interactions even though puzzle generation is not yet implemented.

### Epic 2: Puzzle Generation & Advanced Features

**Goal**: Implement algorithmic puzzle generation using backtracking, add automatic validation feedback, and complete the application with solution verification. This epic transforms the prototype into a fully self-contained application capable of generating unlimited puzzles.

---

## Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Game Loop

**Expanded Goal**: This epic lays the groundwork for the entire project while delivering immediate playable value. We'll set up the repository structure, establish deployment infrastructure, create the visual grid interface, implement user input handling, and enable manual puzzle solving. The epic concludes with a functional Sudoku game using one or more hardcoded puzzles—users can play, complete, and verify their solutions. While puzzle generation is deferred to Epic 2, all core interaction patterns and validation logic are fully implemented here.

### Story 1.1: Repository Setup and Deployment Foundation

As a **developer**,
I want **the project repository initialized with proper structure and deployed to static hosting**,
so that **I have a working deployment pipeline and can immediately see changes live**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository is initialized with appropriate `.gitignore` for web projects
2. Repository contains initial folder structure: `/index.html`, `/styles/`, `/scripts/`, `/docs/`
3. Basic `index.html` exists with minimal content (e.g., "Sudoku App" heading)
4. Static hosting is configured on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
5. The application is accessible via public URL and displays the basic HTML page
6. Deployment automatically updates when changes are pushed to the repository
7. README.md contains the project name, description, and link to live deployment

### Story 1.2: Sudoku Grid Display

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **to see a 9x9 Sudoku grid with clear visual structure**,
so that **I can easily distinguish rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes while playing**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. The HTML structure contains a 9x9 grid of cells (81 total cells)
2. CSS styling clearly delineates the nine 3x3 boxes with thicker borders
3. The grid uses CSS Grid for layout and is centered on the page
4. Each cell is visually distinct with borders separating individual cells
5. The grid is appropriately sized and readable (cells are square, adequate size for numbers)
6. Given clues (pre-filled numbers) are displayed in cells with distinct styling (e.g., bold, different color)
7. Empty cells are visually identifiable as spaces for user input
8. A hardcoded valid Sudoku puzzle is displayed with approximately 25-30 given clues

### Story 1.3: Cell Selection and Input Handling

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **to click cells and enter numbers 1-9**,
so that **I can fill in my solution to the puzzle**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking any empty cell selects it with clear visual feedback (e.g., highlight, border change, background color)
2. Only one cell can be selected at a time
3. Clicking a given clue cell has no effect (cannot be selected or modified)
4. When a cell is selected, typing numbers 1-9 on the keyboard fills that cell with the entered number
5. Typing any other key (letters, symbols, etc.) is ignored
6. Previously entered numbers can be changed by clicking the cell and typing a new number 1-9
7. Pressing Delete, Backspace, or 0 clears the selected cell's content
8. The entered numbers are styled differently from given clues (e.g., regular weight font, different color)
9. Cell selection state persists until another cell is clicked or the selection is explicitly cleared

### Story 1.4: Sudoku Rule Validation

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **immediate visual feedback when I violate Sudoku rules**,
so that **I can identify and correct my mistakes during solving**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. When a number is entered, the application checks for duplicates in the same row
2. When a number is entered, the application checks for duplicates in the same column
3. When a number is entered, the application checks for duplicates in the same 3x3 box
4. If a violation is detected, the offending cell(s) are highlighted in red
5. Red highlighting applies to all cells in the conflict (both the newly entered cell and any existing conflicting cells)
6. Red highlighting is removed automatically when the conflict is resolved (by changing or clearing a number)
7. Validation runs in real-time as numbers are entered (no explicit "Check" button required for basic validation)
8. Given clue cells are included in validation checks but cannot themselves be highlighted as errors (since they're immutable)
9. Multiple simultaneous violations are all highlighted (e.g., if a number violates both row and column rules)

### Story 1.5: Solution Verification and New Puzzle

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **to verify my completed solution and start a new puzzle**,
so that **I know when I've successfully solved the puzzle and can continue playing**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Check Solution" button is visible and enabled at all times
2. Clicking "Check Solution" verifies that all cells are filled (no empty cells remain)
3. If any cells are empty, a message indicates "Puzzle is incomplete"
4. If all cells are filled, the application verifies no Sudoku rule violations exist
5. If the puzzle is correctly solved, a success message is displayed (e.g., "Congratulations! Puzzle solved!")
6. If the puzzle is filled but contains errors, a message indicates "Puzzle contains errors" (existing red highlighting shows where)
7. A "New Puzzle" button is visible at all times
8. Clicking "New Puzzle" loads a different hardcoded puzzle (at least 2-3 hardcoded puzzles should be available, selected randomly or in sequence)
9. Loading a new puzzle clears all user entries and resets the grid to the new puzzle's given clues
10. The hardcoded puzzles are valid, solvable, and have unique solutions

## Epic 2: Puzzle Generation & Advanced Features

**Expanded Goal**: This epic completes the application by implementing algorithmic puzzle generation, eliminating reliance on hardcoded puzzles. We'll build a backtracking-based solver/generator, implement puzzle creation with unique solution verification, and integrate it seamlessly with the existing UI. The epic concludes with a fully self-contained Sudoku application capable of generating unlimited unique puzzles on demand, meeting all MVP success criteria and ready for deployment.

### Story 2.1: Sudoku Solver Implementation

As a **developer**,
I want **a working Sudoku solver using backtracking**,
so that **I can verify puzzle solvability and uniqueness during generation**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. A solver function accepts a 9x9 grid (with some cells filled, others empty) as input
2. The solver uses backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution
3. The solver returns the solved grid if a solution exists
4. The solver returns null or indicates failure if no solution exists
5. The solver can determine if multiple solutions exist (for uniqueness verification)
6. The solver completes in reasonable time (< 1 second for typical puzzles)
7. Unit-style manual testing verifies the solver correctly solves known puzzles
8. The solver code is modular and can be used both for verification and generation

### Story 2.2: Puzzle Generation Algorithm

As a **developer**,
I want **an algorithm to generate valid Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions**,
so that **the application can create unlimited puzzles without hardcoded data**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. A generator function creates a valid, completely filled 9x9 Sudoku grid (solved puzzle)
2. The generator uses backtracking with randomized cell/number selection to ensure puzzle variety
3. The generator removes numbers from the solved grid to create the puzzle (leaving given clues)
4. The generator removes numbers strategically to achieve appropriate difficulty (approximately 40-50 clues remaining for MVP)
5. After each number removal, the generator verifies the puzzle still has a unique solution using the solver
6. If removing a number results in multiple solutions, that number is retained (not removed)
7. The generator completes within 2 seconds (per NFR1)
8. Generated puzzles are valid (all Sudoku rules satisfied in the solution)
9. Generated puzzles are solvable by the solver
10. Generated puzzles have exactly one unique solution

### Story 2.3: Integrate Puzzle Generation with UI

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **new algorithmically generated puzzles when I click "New Puzzle"**,
so that **I have unlimited unique puzzles to solve**.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking "New Puzzle" triggers the puzzle generation algorithm
2. A loading indicator or message appears during generation (e.g., "Generating puzzle...")
3. The new generated puzzle replaces the current grid within 2 seconds
4. The grid displays the new puzzle's given clues with proper styling
5. All user entries from the previous puzzle are cleared
6. The newly generated puzzle is fully playable with all existing input and validation functionality
7. Each generated puzzle is different from the previous one (sufficient randomization)
8. If generation fails or times out, an error message is displayed and the user can retry
9. The hardcoded puzzles from Epic 1 are removed; the application now relies entirely on generation
10. The application loads with a freshly generated puzzle automatically on first visit

### Story 2.4: Final Polish and Deployment

5. Performance meets NFR1 and NFR2 (puzzle generation < 2 seconds, UI interactions < 100ms)
6. The deployed application is accessible via public URL and functions identically to local development
7. Code is organized cleanly across modular JavaScript files (data, validation, generation, UI)
8. Basic code comments explain complex logic (especially in solver/generator algorithms)
9. Documentation is updated: README contains project description, features, and live demo link
10. All MVP success criteria from the Project Brief are satisfied and verified through manual testing

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

*UX Expert consultation is not required for this MVP. The UI design goals are sufficiently straightforward (single-screen application with minimal controls) that the Design Architect can incorporate UX decisions directly into the technical architecture without a separate UX design phase.*

### Architect Prompt

**Prompt for the Architect**:

Please review this PRD and create a comprehensive technical architecture document. The architecture should specify:

1. **Code Organization**: Define the modular structure for JavaScript files (data/state module, validation module, solver/generator module, UI module) with clear interfaces between modules
2. **Data Structures**: Specify exactly how the grid state, given clues, and user entries will be represented in JavaScript
3. **Algorithm Details**: Provide pseudocode or implementation guidance for the backtracking solver and puzzle generator
4. **UI Implementation**: Define the HTML structure, CSS styling approach (CSS Grid layout), and event handling patterns for cell selection and input
5. **Performance Considerations**: Address puzzle generation performance and any optimizations needed to meet NFR1 and NFR2
6. **Deployment Configuration**: Specify which static hosting platform to use and configuration steps

The architecture should enable straightforward implementation by following the epic/story sequence in this PRD while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
