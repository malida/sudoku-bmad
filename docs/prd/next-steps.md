# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

*UX Expert consultation is not required for this MVP. The UI design goals are sufficiently straightforward (single-screen application with minimal controls) that the Design Architect can incorporate UX decisions directly into the technical architecture without a separate UX design phase.*

## Architect Prompt

**Prompt for the Architect**:

Please review this PRD and create a comprehensive technical architecture document. The architecture should specify:

1. **Code Organization**: Define the modular structure for JavaScript files (data/state module, validation module, solver/generator module, UI module) with clear interfaces between modules
2. **Data Structures**: Specify exactly how the grid state, given clues, and user entries will be represented in JavaScript
3. **Algorithm Details**: Provide pseudocode or implementation guidance for the backtracking solver and puzzle generator
4. **UI Implementation**: Define the HTML structure, CSS styling approach (CSS Grid layout), and event handling patterns for cell selection and input
5. **Performance Considerations**: Address puzzle generation performance and any optimizations needed to meet NFR1 and NFR2
6. **Deployment Configuration**: Specify which static hosting platform to use and configuration steps

The architecture should enable straightforward implementation by following the epic/story sequence in this PRD while maintaining clean, maintainable code structure.
