# Epic 2: Puzzle Generation & Advanced Features

**Expanded Goal**: This epic completes the application by implementing algorithmic puzzle generation, eliminating reliance on hardcoded puzzles. We'll build a backtracking-based solver/generator, implement puzzle creation with unique solution verification, and integrate it seamlessly with the existing UI. The epic concludes with a fully self-contained Sudoku application capable of generating unlimited unique puzzles on demand, meeting all MVP success criteria and ready for deployment.

## Story 2.1: Sudoku Solver Implementation

As a **developer**,
I want **a working Sudoku solver using backtracking**,
so that **I can verify puzzle solvability and uniqueness during generation**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. A solver function accepts a 9x9 grid (with some cells filled, others empty) as input
2. The solver uses backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution
3. The solver returns the solved grid if a solution exists
4. The solver returns null or indicates failure if no solution exists
5. The solver can determine if multiple solutions exist (for uniqueness verification)
6. The solver completes in reasonable time (< 1 second for typical puzzles)
7. Unit-style manual testing verifies the solver correctly solves known puzzles
8. The solver code is modular and can be used both for verification and generation

## Story 2.2: Puzzle Generation Algorithm

As a **developer**,
I want **an algorithm to generate valid Sudoku puzzles with unique solutions**,
so that **the application can create unlimited puzzles without hardcoded data**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. A generator function creates a valid, completely filled 9x9 Sudoku grid (solved puzzle)
2. The generator uses backtracking with randomized cell/number selection to ensure puzzle variety
3. The generator removes numbers from the solved grid to create the puzzle (leaving given clues)
4. The generator removes numbers strategically to achieve appropriate difficulty (approximately 40-50 clues remaining for MVP)
5. After each number removal, the generator verifies the puzzle still has a unique solution using the solver
6. If removing a number results in multiple solutions, that number is retained (not removed)
7. The generator completes within 2 seconds (per NFR1)
8. Generated puzzles are valid (all Sudoku rules satisfied in the solution)
9. Generated puzzles are solvable by the solver
10. Generated puzzles have exactly one unique solution

## Story 2.3: Integrate Puzzle Generation with UI

As a **Sudoku player**,
I want **new algorithmically generated puzzles when I click "New Puzzle"**,
so that **I have unlimited unique puzzles to solve**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking "New Puzzle" triggers the puzzle generation algorithm
2. A loading indicator or message appears during generation (e.g., "Generating puzzle...")
3. The new generated puzzle replaces the current grid within 2 seconds
4. The grid displays the new puzzle's given clues with proper styling
5. All user entries from the previous puzzle are cleared
6. The newly generated puzzle is fully playable with all existing input and validation functionality
7. Each generated puzzle is different from the previous one (sufficient randomization)
8. If generation fails or times out, an error message is displayed and the user can retry
9. The hardcoded puzzles from Epic 1 are removed; the application now relies entirely on generation
10. The application loads with a freshly generated puzzle automatically on first visit

## Story 2.4: Final Polish and Deployment

As a **Sudoku player and project stakeholder**,
I want **a polished, fully functional application deployed and accessible**,
so that **the MVP is complete and ready for use**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. All console errors and warnings are resolved
2. The application functions correctly across latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
3. Basic mobile responsiveness is verified (application is usable on mobile browsers, though not necessarily optimized)
4. The "Check Solution" button correctly verifies algorithmically generated puzzles
5. Performance meets NFR1 and NFR2 (puzzle generation < 2 seconds, UI interactions < 100ms)
6. The deployed application is accessible via public URL and functions identically to local development
7. Code is organized cleanly across modular JavaScript files (data, validation, generation, UI)
8. Basic code comments explain complex logic (especially in solver/generator algorithms)
9. Documentation is updated: README contains project description, features, and live demo link
10. All MVP success criteria from the Project Brief are satisfied and verified through manual testing
