# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing all application code, assets, and documentation. Given the small scope, a simple flat or shallow folder structure is appropriate:
- `/index.html` - Main entry point
- `/styles/` - CSS files
- `/scripts/` - JavaScript modules
- `/docs/` - Project documentation (brief, PRD, brainstorming results)

No build tooling, package managers, or complex repository structure is necessary for MVP.

## Service Architecture

**Client-Side Monolith** - The entire application runs in the browser with no server-side components. JavaScript code is organized into logical modules (data/state management, validation logic, puzzle generation algorithms, UI rendering/interaction) but deployed as a cohesive client-side application.

No backend services, APIs, databases, or serverless functions are required. The architecture is intentionally simple to support zero-cost static hosting and eliminate deployment complexity.

## Testing Requirements

**Manual Testing** - For MVP, testing will be manual and exploratory. The developer will verify each requirement and user flow by directly interacting with the application during development.

**Rationale**: Given the educational nature of the project and limited scope, investing in automated test infrastructure (unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests) is not warranted for MVP. The focus is on completing functional features and deploying a working application.

**Post-MVP**: If the project continues beyond MVP, unit tests for the validation and generation algorithms would be valuable additions.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **ES6+ JavaScript**: Use modern JavaScript features (modules, arrow functions, const/let, template literals, etc.) assuming browser support for ES6 and beyond
- **CSS Grid for Layout**: Use CSS Grid for the 9x9 Sudoku grid layout, leveraging native browser layout capabilities
- **No Build Process Initially**: Deploy raw HTML/CSS/JS files directly without transpilation, bundling, or minification for MVP simplicity
- **Puzzle Generation Algorithm**: Implement backtracking-based puzzle generation; start with a solved grid (generated via backtracking with random cell ordering) and remove numbers while ensuring unique solvability
- **Unique Solution Verification**: Implement a basic solver to verify puzzles have unique solutions; this is necessary to ensure quality puzzles
- **State Management**: Use simple JavaScript objects/arrays to track game state; no state management library needed
- **Code Organization**: Use ES6 modules (import/export) to organize code into logical units, but keep the module structure simple and flat
- **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for puzzle generation failures (e.g., if generation times out, retry or use fallback puzzle)
- **Performance Considerations**: If puzzle generation is slow, consider generating puzzles in the background using Web Workers (post-MVP optimization if needed)
