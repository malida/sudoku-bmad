# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience should be clean, focused, and free of distractions. Upon loading the application, users immediately see a Sudoku puzzle ready to play—no splash screens, no tutorial overlays, no registration walls. The interface prioritizes the puzzle grid as the central focus, with minimal surrounding controls (just a "New Puzzle" button and potentially a "Check Solution" button).

Visual feedback is immediate and intuitive: clicking a cell clearly shows it's selected, invalid entries turn red instantly, and successfully solving the puzzle provides clear positive confirmation. The design philosophy is "invisible interface"—users should focus on the puzzle, not figuring out how to use the app.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Direct Manipulation**: Click/tap cells directly to select them, type numbers directly on keyboard
- **Immediate Feedback**: Validation happens in real-time as users enter numbers, not on form submission
- **Forgiving Input**: Users can freely change their entries; the app flags errors but doesn't prevent them (educational approach)
- **Minimal Controls**: Primary action is "New Puzzle"; solution verification may be automatic on completion or via explicit button

## Core Screens and Views

**Single Game Screen**: The entire application consists of one primary view containing:
- The 9x9 Sudoku grid (central focus)
- New Puzzle button
- Optional: Check Solution button (if not automatic)
- Optional: Simple status indicator (e.g., "Solving..." or "Solved!")

No additional screens, navigation, menus, or modal dialogs are required for MVP.

## Accessibility

**None** - Accessibility features (keyboard navigation beyond basic number entry, screen reader support, high contrast modes) are explicitly out of scope for MVP. These may be added in post-MVP phases.

## Branding

**Minimal/None** - The application should have a clean, simple aesthetic with good typography and clear visual hierarchy. No specific brand identity, logos, or color schemes are required beyond functional design (e.g., red for errors, distinct styling for given clues vs. user entries, clear grid borders for 3x3 boxes).

## Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Primary target is desktop browsers, but the application should be functional (though not necessarily optimized) on mobile browsers. The design should adapt reasonably to different viewport sizes without requiring separate mobile-specific implementations. Touch interactions (tapping cells) should work alongside mouse clicks.
