# Epic List

## Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Game Loop

**Goal**: Establish project repository, basic HTML/CSS structure, and implement the core Sudoku gameplay loop with hardcoded puzzles. By the end of this epic, users can play a complete Sudoku game with manual validation, demonstrating all essential interactions even though puzzle generation is not yet implemented.

## Epic 2: Puzzle Generation & Advanced Features

**Goal**: Implement algorithmic puzzle generation using backtracking, add automatic validation feedback, and complete the application with solution verification. This epic transforms the prototype into a fully self-contained application capable of generating unlimited puzzles.
