# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Successfully apply the complete BMAD methodology (brainstorming, planning, development, deployment) to create a functional web application
- Build a self-contained, client-side Sudoku game with algorithmic puzzle generation, real-time validation, and solution verification
- Deploy the application at zero cost on static hosting infrastructure
- Deliver a clean, distraction-free user experience for casual Sudoku players
- Demonstrate disciplined scope management by completing all core features without scope creep
- Create well-structured, maintainable code that serves as a reference for future BMAD-based projects

## Background Context

This project emerged from a structured brainstorming session using First Principles Thinking and SCAMPER methodology to identify the essential requirements for a Sudoku web application. The project serves dual purposes: as an educational vehicle for learning the BMAD method through practical application, and as a functional puzzle game for casual players seeking a simple, ad-free experience.

The key insight from the planning phase was that a complete Sudoku application requires only five fundamental capabilities: displaying a 9x9 grid, accepting user input, validating against Sudoku rules, generating puzzles algorithmically, and verifying solutions. By constraining scope to these essentials and deliberately excluding common features (hints, timers, difficulty selection, social features), the project remains achievable within a learning timeline while still delivering complete functionality.

The technical approach emphasizes simplicity and self-containment: pure vanilla JavaScript with no framework dependencies, client-side only architecture with no backend services, and static hosting deployment. This eliminates cost barriers and infrastructure complexity while focusing learning on fundamentals.
