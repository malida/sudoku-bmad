# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No user input handling in solution verification; button clicks trigger controlled state transitions"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "isGridComplete() checks 81 cells in <1ms; solution verification instant; puzzle loading <10ms"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive state reset on new puzzle; 3-stage verification (incomplete/errors/success); robust message system"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Consider making message auto-hide duration configurable or context-sensitive"
      refs: ["scripts/ui.js:88-91", "scripts/main.js:114"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Currently hardcoded to 3 seconds; could be configurable based on message type (success longer, info shorter)"
