# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Static rendering with no user input handling in this story; no security concerns"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Grid renders instantly (<100ms per NFR2); 81 cells created efficiently via DocumentFragment pattern potential"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with null checks for DOM elements; deep copying prevents state mutation"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with JSDoc on all functions; clear separation of concerns across modules"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No immediate actions required
  future:
    - action: "Consider using DocumentFragment for batch DOM insertion to optimize initial render (micro-optimization)"
      refs: ["scripts/ui.js:56-68"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current implementation is already fast enough (<100ms), but DocumentFragment would reduce reflows"
