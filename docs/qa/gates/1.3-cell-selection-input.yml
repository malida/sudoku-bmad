# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.3
# Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core

schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Cell Selection and Input Handling"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 9 acceptance criteria fully met with excellent implementation. Event handling uses proper delegation pattern, input validation is robust, state management clean, and visual feedback clear. Minor suggestion for Backspace preventDefault placement."

# Gate status
waiver: { active: false }

# Issues found but addressed
top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Grid re-renders on every keystroke could be optimized to only update changed cell"
    suggested_action: "Consider selective cell update instead of full grid re-render (post-MVP optimization)"

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 0, low: 1 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix: []
    monitor:
      - "Grid re-rendering performance remains well within NFR2 (<100ms) but could be optimized for larger grids"

# Quality metrics

# Evidence
evidence:
  tests_reviewed: 6  # Manual test scenarios from testing section
  risks_identified: 1  # Performance optimization opportunity
  trace:
    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  # All 9 ACs have complete coverage
    ac_gaps: []  # No coverage gaps

# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation via regex prevents injection; only numbers 0-9 accepted; no eval or innerHTML usage"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All interactions respond instantly (<100ms per NFR2); event delegation efficient; full grid re-render acceptable for 81 cells"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust bounds checking; null checks for selection state; preventDefault() on Backspace prevents navigation bugs"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean event handling patterns; clear separation of concerns; comprehensive JSDoc maintained"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Consider selective DOM updates instead of full grid re-render on keystroke"
      refs: ["scripts/main.js:56-58", "scripts/main.js:70-72"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current implementation is fast enough (<100ms), but updating only changed cell would be more efficient"
    - action: "Consider adding visual feedback for invalid key presses (brief shake animation or message)"
      refs: ["scripts/main.js:37-75"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "UX enhancement - currently silently ignores invalid input"
