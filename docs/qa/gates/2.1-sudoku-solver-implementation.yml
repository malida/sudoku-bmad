recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding input validation (grid format, bounds checking) for defensive programming"
      refs: ["scripts/generator.js:18-66"]
      rationale: "Current implementation works correctly but assumes valid inputs. Not critical for internal use but would improve robustness."
    - action: "Add automated test for unsolvable puzzle scenario when test framework introduced"
      refs: ["test-solver.mjs:65-71"]
      rationale: "Currently skipped for valid performance reasons. Future test framework could use timeout-based testing."
    - action: "Evaluate potential code reuse with validation.js module"
      refs: ["scripts/generator.js:39-66", "scripts/validation.js"]
      rationale: "Dev Notes mention similar logic exists in validation.js. Review for potential consolidation if beneficial."

test_architecture_assessment:
  approach: "Manual testing with comprehensive test scenarios"
  alignment: "Fully aligned with project testing strategy (manual testing only per PRD)"
  coverage_quality: "Excellent - 8 distinct test cases covering functional requirements, edge cases, and performance"
  test_levels: "Appropriate - unit-level testing for algorithmic module"
  edge_cases: "Well covered - empty grid, multiple solutions, performance benchmarks, mutation protection"
  maintainability: "High - well-organized test file with clear test descriptions and assertions"
  gaps:
    - description: "Unsolvable puzzle test skipped"
      severity: low
