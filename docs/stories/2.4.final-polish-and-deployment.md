## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Depends on:**
- Story 2.3 (requires integrated puzzle generation with UI)
- Story 2.2 (requires working generator)
- Story 2.1 (requires working solver)
- All Epic 1 stories (complete UI and interaction foundation)

**Previous Story Insights:**

From Story 2.3:
- `handleNewPuzzle()` in main.js generates puzzles using `generator.generatePuzzle()`
- Loading messages display during generation
- Error handling for generation failures
- Hardcoded puzzles removed from state.js
- Application loads with generated puzzle on first visit

From Story 2.2:
- `generatePuzzle()` creates valid puzzles with unique solutions
- Generation completes within 2 seconds
- Returns 9x9 grid with ~45 given clues
- Uses backtracking with randomization for variety

From Story 2.1:
- `solvePuzzle()` solves puzzles using backtracking
- `hasUniqueSolution()` verifies exactly one solution exists
- Solver completes in < 1 second for typical puzzles

From Epic 1:
- Complete UI with grid display, cell selection, input handling
- Real-time validation with error highlighting
- Solution verification and puzzle loading
- Event handling and state management

Story 2.4 is the final polish phase - no new features, only verification, cleanup, documentation, and ensuring production readiness.

**File Locations:**
All files already exist from previous stories. No new files needed for Story 2.4.

Primary files to review/update:
- `index.html` - Verify viewport meta tag, check for console errors
- `scripts/main.js` - Remove debug logs, verify event handling
- `scripts/state.js` - Review state management, add comments if needed
- `scripts/validation.js` - Verify validation logic, add JSDoc
- `scripts/generator.js` - Add comprehensive comments for algorithms
- `scripts/ui.js` - Review DOM manipulation, verify message handling
- `styles/sudoku.css` - Verify responsive behavior on mobile
- `README.md` - Update with full documentation
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Deployment Configuration:**

Per deployment-architecture.md:
- **Platform:** GitHub Pages
- **Deployment Trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Build Process:** None (static files)
- **URL Format:** `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: `main`
4. Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Save - auto-deploys on every push

[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]

**Performance Targets:**

Per performance-optimization.md:
- **NFR1:** Puzzle generation < 2 seconds (measure with console.time)
- **NFR2:** UI interactions < 100 milliseconds (test responsiveness manually)

**Optimization Notes:**
- Early termination in `countSolutions` after finding 2 solutions ✓
- Event delegation for cell clicks (single listener on grid container) ✓
- Minimal DOM updates (full grid re-render acceptable for MVP) ✓
- No external dependencies = fast load time ✓

If performance issues found:
- Increase target clues from 45 to 50 (faster generation)
- Consider Web Workers for background generation (post-MVP)

[Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]

**Code Quality Standards:**

Per coding-standards.md:
- **JSDoc:** All public API functions should have JSDoc comments
- **Inline Comments:** Complex algorithms (backtracking) need explanatory comments
- **Console Logs:** Remove or comment out all console.log() before deployment (NFR8)
- **Naming:** camelCase for functions/variables, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Deep Copying:** JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for grid cloning
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch wraps generator calls with user-friendly messages

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Browser Compatibility:**

Per PRD NFR3:
- **Chrome:** Latest 2 major versions
- **Firefox:** Latest 2 major versions
- **Safari:** Latest 2 major versions (includes iOS Safari)
- **Edge:** Latest 2 major versions

**Test Focus:**
- ES6 module support (import/export)
- CSS Grid layout rendering
- Event listeners (click, keydown)
- localStorage (if used - not in current scope)

[Source: prd.md#non-functional-requirements]

**Mobile Responsiveness:**

Per PRD:
- **Target:** Functional on mobile, not necessarily optimized
- **Test Devices:** iPhone (Safari), Android (Chrome)
- **Key Tests:**
  - Grid displays and is readable
  - Touch tap works for cell selection
  - Mobile keyboard input works
  - Buttons are tappable (adequate touch target size)
  - No horizontal scrolling required

**Viewport Meta Tag:**
Verify index.html includes:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

[Source: prd.md#target-device-and-platforms]

**Documentation Requirements:**

Per AC 9, README.md should include:
1. **Project Description:** What is this application?
2. **Features:** List of core capabilities (grid display, input, validation, generation, verification)
3. **How to Play:** Brief instructions for users
4. **Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6 modules)
5. **Live Demo:** Link to deployed URL
6. **Local Development:** How to run locally (simple HTTP server)

**Suggested README Structure:**
```markdown
