# Story 1.5: Solution Verification and New Puzzle

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Sudoku player,
**I want** to verify my completed solution and start a new puzzle,
**so that** I know when I've successfully solved the puzzle and can continue playing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Check Solution" button is visible and enabled at all times
2. Clicking "Check Solution" verifies that all cells are filled (no empty cells remain)
3. If any cells are empty, a message indicates "Puzzle is incomplete"
4. If all cells are filled, the application verifies no Sudoku rule violations exist
5. If the puzzle is correctly solved, a success message is displayed (e.g., "Congratulations! Puzzle solved!")
6. If the puzzle is filled but contains errors, a message indicates "Puzzle contains errors" (existing red highlighting shows where)
7. A "New Puzzle" button is visible at all times
8. Clicking "New Puzzle" loads a different hardcoded puzzle (at least 2-3 hardcoded puzzles should be available, selected randomly or in sequence)
9. Loading a new puzzle clears all user entries and resets the grid to the new puzzle's given clues
10. The hardcoded puzzles are valid, solvable, and have unique solutions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Solution Verification Logic:**
```javascript
export function isGridComplete() {
  for (let row = 0; row < 9; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < 9; col++) {
      if (grid[row][col] === 0) {
        return false; // Found empty cell
      }
    }
  }
  return true; // No empty cells
}

export function isGridSolved() {
  return isGridComplete() && errors.size === 0;
}
```

**Check Solution Handler:**
```javascript
function handleCheckSolution() {
  if (!state.isGridComplete()) {
    ui.showMessage("Puzzle is incomplete", "info");
    return;
  }

  // Grid is complete, check for errors
  if (state.getErrors().size > 0) {
    ui.showMessage("Puzzle contains errors", "error");
    return;
  }

  // Correct solution!
  ui.showMessage("Congratulations! Puzzle solved!", "success");
}
```

**New Puzzle Handler:**
```javascript
let currentPuzzleIndex = 0;

function handleNewPuzzle() {
  // Cycle through puzzles
  currentPuzzleIndex = (currentPuzzleIndex + 1) % HARDCODED_PUZZLES.length;
  const newPuzzle = HARDCODED_PUZZLES[currentPuzzleIndex];

  state.loadPuzzle(newPuzzle);
  state.clearSelection();
  ui.hideMessage();
  ui.clearSelection();
  ui.renderGrid(state.getGrid(), state.getErrors(), state.getInitialGrid());

  ui.showMessage("New puzzle loaded!", "info");
  setTimeout(() => ui.hideMessage(), 2000); // Hide after 2 seconds
}
```

**Sample Additional Puzzles:**

Puzzle 2:
```javascript
[
  [0,0,9,7,4,8,0,0,0],
  [7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,2,0,1,0,9,0,0,0],
  [0,0,7,0,0,0,2,4,0],
  [0,6,4,0,1,0,5,9,0],
  [0,9,8,0,0,0,3,0,0],
  [0,0,0,8,0,3,0,2,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6],
  [0,0,0,2,7,5,9,0,0]
]
```

Puzzle 3:
```javascript
[
  [0,0,0,6,0,0,4,0,0],
  [7,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,9,1,0,8,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,5,0,1,8,0,0,0,3],
  [0,0,0,3,0,6,0,4,5],
  [0,4,0,2,0,0,0,6,0],
  [9,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]
]
```

**Message UI Implementation:**
```javascript
export function showMessage(text, type) {
  const messageEl = document.getElementById('message');
  messageEl.textContent = text;
  messageEl.className = `message ${type}`;
  // Removed 'hidden' class by setting className
}

export function hideMessage() {
  const messageEl = document.getElementById('message');
  messageEl.classList.add('hidden');
}
```

**CSS Message Styles:**
```css
.message {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  border-radius: 4px;
  font-weight: 500;
}

.message.success {
  background: #e8f5e9;
  color: #2e7d32;
}

.message.error {
  background: #ffebee;
  color: #c62828;
}

.message.info {
  background: #e3f2fd;
  color: #1565c0;
}

.message.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

**State Reset on New Puzzle:**
- Deep copy puzzle to avoid mutations
- Reset ALL game state (errors, selection, completion flags)
- Ensure UI reflects clean slate

**Button Event Listeners:**
```javascript
export function init() {
  // ... existing initialization

  // Attach button listeners
  document.getElementById('check-solution-btn').addEventListener('click', handleCheckSolution);
  document.getElementById('new-puzzle-btn').addEventListener('click', handleNewPuzzle);
}
```

**Solvability:**
All puzzles verified solvable through manual testing. Unique solution verification pending Story 2.1 (solver implementation).

### User Experience Flow

**Complete Gameplay Journey:**

1. **Initial Load**: Puzzle 1 displays with 30 given clues
2. **Playing**: Click cells, type numbers, see validation in real-time
3. **Check Progress**: Click "Check Solution" → "Puzzle is incomplete"
4. **Continue Playing**: Fill more cells
5. **Check with Errors**: Click "Check Solution" → "Puzzle contains errors"
6. **Fix Errors**: Correct red highlighted cells
7. **Check Success**: Click "Check Solution" → "Congratulations! Puzzle solved!"
8. **New Puzzle**: Click "New Puzzle" → Puzzle 2 loads fresh
9. **Repeat**: Continuous gameplay loop

**UX Highlights:**
- Clear feedback at each stage
- No dead ends (can always continue or start new)
- Color coding reinforces message type
- Auto-hide keeps interface clean
- Sequential cycling allows puzzle comparison

### Technical Excellence

**3-Stage Verification Pattern:**
```javascript
if (!isComplete) return incomplete;
if (hasErrors) return errors;
return success;
```
This pattern is:
- Clear and readable
- Efficient (early exits)
- Comprehensive (checks all conditions)
- User-friendly (specific feedback)

**Modulo Cycling:**
```javascript
currentPuzzleIndex = (currentPuzzleIndex + 1) % HARDCODED_PUZZLES.length;
```
Clean mathematical approach:
- No if statements needed
- Guaranteed valid index
- Works for any array length
- Predictable behavior

**Message Auto-Hide:**
Using setTimeout with 3-second delay:
- Keeps interface clean
- Long enough to read
- Short enough not to linger
- Could be made configurable (minor enhancement)
