# Story 2.1: Sudoku Solver Implementation

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a working Sudoku solver using backtracking,
**so that** I can verify puzzle solvability and uniqueness during generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A solver function accepts a 9x9 grid (with some cells filled, others empty) as input
2. The solver uses backtracking algorithm to find a valid solution
3. The solver returns the solved grid if a solution exists
4. The solver returns null or indicates failure if no solution exists
5. The solver can determine if multiple solutions exist (for uniqueness verification)
6. The solver completes in reasonable time (< 1 second for typical puzzles)
7. Unit-style manual testing verifies the solver correctly solves known puzzles
8. The solver code is modular and can be used both for verification and generation

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create generator.js module (AC: 1, 8)
  - [ ] Create file `scripts/generator.js` with ES6 module exports
  - [ ] Import validation module for isValidPlacement logic
  - [ ] Set up module structure with imports and exports

- [ ] Implement helper function: findEmptyCell(grid) (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Scan grid row by row to find first cell with value 0
  - [ ] Return `{row, col}` object for first empty cell found
  - [ ] Return `null` if no empty cells exist (grid is complete)
  - [ ] Add JSDoc documentation with param and return types

- [ ] Implement helper function: isValidPlacement(grid, row, col, num) (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Check row for duplicate of num (return false if found)
  - [ ] Check column for duplicate of num (return false if found)
  - [ ] Calculate 3x3 box starting coordinates: `boxRow = Math.floor(row/3)*3`, `boxCol = Math.floor(col/3)*3`
  - [ ] Check 3x3 box for duplicate of num (return false if found)
  - [ ] Return true if placement is valid (no conflicts)
  - [ ] Add JSDoc documentation explaining validation logic

- [ ] Implement main solver: solvePuzzle(grid) (AC: 2, 3, 4, 6)
  - [ ] Find next empty cell using findEmptyCell()
  - [ ] Base case: if no empty cell, return grid (solution found)
  - [ ] Try numbers 1-9 in current empty cell
  - [ ] For each number, check if valid using isValidPlacement()
  - [ ] If valid: place number, recursively call solvePuzzle()
  - [ ] If recursive call succeeds, return grid (solution found downstream)
  - [ ] If recursive call fails, backtrack (set cell back to 0)
  - [ ] If no number works, return null (trigger backtracking)
  - [ ] Implement deep copy of input grid to avoid mutation: `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(grid))`
  - [ ] Add JSDoc with clear explanation of backtracking algorithm

- [ ] Implement solution counter: countSolutions(grid, maxCount) (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Deep copy input grid to avoid mutations
  - [ ] Initialize count = 0
  - [ ] Implement recursive solve function that increments count when solution found
  - [ ] Early exit optimization: stop recursion if count >= maxCount
  - [ ] Use findEmptyCell() to find next empty position
  - [ ] Try numbers 1-9, recursively count solutions
  - [ ] Backtrack after exploring each branch
  - [ ] Return total count of solutions found
  - [ ] Add JSDoc explaining purpose (uniqueness verification)

- [ ] Implement uniqueness checker: hasUniqueSolution(grid) (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Call countSolutions(grid, 2) to find up to 2 solutions
  - [ ] Return true if exactly 1 solution found
  - [ ] Return false if 0 or 2+ solutions found
  - [ ] Add JSDoc documentation

- [ ] Export public API functions (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Export solvePuzzle() as primary public function
  - [ ] Export hasUniqueSolution() for generator use
  - [ ] Export countSolutions() for advanced verification
  - [ ] Keep isValidPlacement() and findEmptyCell() as internal helpers (not exported)

- [ ] Manual testing and verification (AC: 6, 7)
  - [ ] Test 1: Solve incomplete puzzle from Story 1.5 (verify correct solution)
  - [ ] Test 2: Solve empty grid (should return valid filled grid)
  - [ ] Test 3: Attempt to solve invalid puzzle with no solution (should return null)
  - [ ] Test 4: Verify performance < 1 second for typical puzzles
  - [ ] Test 5: Test hasUniqueSolution() with puzzle that has unique solution (return true)
  - [ ] Test 6: Test hasUniqueSolution() with under-constrained puzzle (return false)
  - [ ] Test 7: Verify countSolutions() stops early at maxCount (performance check)
  - [ ] Document test results in Dev Agent Record section

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Previous Story Insights:**
From Story 1.5, the application currently has:
- State management in `scripts/state.js` with grid data structure (9x9 number[][])
- Validation logic in `scripts/validation.js` for rule checking
- Grid rendering in `scripts/ui.js`
- Main coordinator in `scripts/main.js`

The solver will be a new module that integrates with the existing validation logic.

**File Location:**
Create `scripts/generator.js` as specified in source-tree.md. This module will contain solver algorithms and (in future stories) puzzle generation logic.
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#scripts-directory]

**Module Structure:**
```javascript
// generator.js module structure
import { validateGrid } from './validation.js';

// Internal helper functions
function findEmptyCell(grid) { /* ... */ }
function isValidPlacement(grid, row, col, num) { /* ... */ }

// Public API functions
export function solvePuzzle(grid) { /* ... */ }
export function countSolutions(grid, maxCount) { /* ... */ }
export function hasUniqueSolution(grid) { /* ... */ }
```
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#module-dependencies]

**Data Models:**
- **Grid Format:** `number[][]` - 9x9 two-dimensional array
- **Empty Cell:** Represented by 0
- **Filled Cell:** Represented by 1-9
- **Cell Coordinate:** `{row: number, col: number}` where both are 0-8
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#sudokugrid]

**Algorithm Implementation:**
Use backtracking algorithm as specified in architecture. Complete pseudocode provided shows:
1. Find empty cell
2. Try numbers 1-9
3. Check validity with isValidPlacement (row, column, 3x3 box)
4. Recursively solve
5. Backtrack if no solution

Key implementation details:
- **3x3 Box Calculation:** `boxRow = Math.floor(row/3)*3`, `boxCol = Math.floor(col/3)*3`
- **Deep Copying:** Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(grid))` to avoid mutation
- **Early Exit:** countSolutions stops after finding maxCount solutions for performance
[Source: architecture/algorithm-implementations.md#backtracking-solver-pseudocode]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Solver must complete in < 1 second for typical puzzles (NFR1 target: < 2 seconds, but solver should be faster)
- countSolutions optimization: stop early when reaching maxCount (typically 2 for uniqueness check)
[Source: prd.md#non-functional-requirements]

**Testing Strategy:**
Manual testing approach per architecture. Create test cases that:
- Verify correct solution for solvable puzzles
- Verify null return for unsolvable puzzles
- Verify uniqueness detection works correctly
- Measure performance with console.time()
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-approach]

**Coding Standards:**
- Use camelCase for function names: `solvePuzzle`, `findEmptyCell`
- Use JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Complex algorithms like backtracking should have inline comments
- Validate grid indices are in range 0-8 before access
- Use const/let (no var)
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Integration Points:**
- Can leverage existing validation.js for initial implementation
- isValidPlacement logic is similar to existing validateGrid but focused on single cell
- Future integration: main.js will call solvePuzzle via generator.js
- Future integration: generator.js will import and use solvePuzzle for puzzle creation
[Source: architecture/module-interfaces-and-data-flow.md]

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual testing with known puzzles and edge cases

**Manual Test Checklist:**

1. **Test Solvable Puzzle (AC: 2, 3, 6):**
   - Load one of the hardcoded puzzles from Story 1.5
   - Make a copy of the grid
   - Call solvePuzzle(gridCopy)
   - Verify it returns a valid solved grid (all cells 1-9)
   - Verify solution satisfies Sudoku rules (no conflicts)
   - Measure time with console.time() - should be < 1 second

2. **Test Empty Grid (AC: 2, 3, 6):**
   - Create empty 9x9 grid (all zeros)
   - Call solvePuzzle(emptyGrid)
   - Verify it returns a valid filled grid
   - Verify grid has no rule violations

3. **Test Unsolvable Puzzle (AC: 4):**
   - Create puzzle with conflicting clues (impossible to solve)
   - Call solvePuzzle(impossibleGrid)
   - Verify it returns null
   - Verify it doesn't hang (performance check)

4. **Test Uniqueness Detection - Unique (AC: 5):**
   - Use a hardcoded puzzle from Story 1.5 (known unique solution)
   - Call hasUniqueSolution(puzzle)
   - Verify it returns true

5. **Test Uniqueness Detection - Multiple (AC: 5):**
   - Create under-constrained puzzle (e.g., only 10 clues)
   - Call hasUniqueSolution(underConstrainedPuzzle)
   - Verify it returns false (multiple solutions exist)

6. **Test countSolutions Performance (AC: 5, 6):**
   - Create puzzle with many solutions
   - Call countSolutions(puzzle, 2)
   - Verify it returns 2 (stopped early, didn't count all)
   - Verify performance is fast (early exit working)

7. **Test Deep Copy Protection (AC: 8):**
   - Create test grid
   - Call solvePuzzle(testGrid)
   - Verify original testGrid is unchanged (no mutations)

8. **Performance Benchmark (AC: 6):**
   - Test with 5-10 different puzzles of varying difficulty
   - Measure solve time for each
   - Verify all complete in < 1 second
   - Note: Very easy puzzles should solve in < 100ms

**Expected Behaviors:**
- Solver finds valid solutions for solvable puzzles
- Solver returns null for impossible puzzles
- Performance is well under 1 second threshold
- Original grids are never mutated
- Uniqueness detection correctly identifies single-solution puzzles
