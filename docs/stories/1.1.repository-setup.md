# Story 1.1: Repository Setup and Deployment Foundation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the project repository initialized with proper structure and deployed to static hosting,
**so that** I have a working deployment pipeline and can immediately see changes live.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository is initialized with appropriate `.gitignore` for web projects
2. Repository contains initial folder structure: `/index.html`, `/styles/`, `/scripts/`, `/docs/`
3. Basic `index.html` exists with minimal content (e.g., "Sudoku App" heading)
4. Static hosting is configured on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
5. The application is accessible via public URL and displays the basic HTML page
6. Deployment automatically updates when changes are pushed to the repository
7. README.md contains the project name, description, and link to live deployment

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Git repository (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `git init` if not already initialized
  - [x] Create `.gitignore` with entries for: `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `.env`, `*.log`

- [x] Create project folder structure (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `/styles/` directory
  - [x] Create `/scripts/` directory
  - [x] Verify `/docs/` directory exists (should already contain PRD and Architecture)

- [x] Create basic index.html (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add DOCTYPE and HTML5 boilerplate
  - [x] Add `<head>` with charset, viewport meta tag, and title "Sudoku"
  - [x] Add basic structure: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<h1>Sudoku App</h1>`
  - [x] Link to `styles/sudoku.css` (file doesn't exist yet, that's okay)
  - [x] Link to `scripts/main.js` with `type="module"`

- [x] Configure static hosting (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Choose hosting platform: GitHub Pages (recommended)
  - [x] Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings:
    - Go to Settings → Pages
    - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
    - Select branch: `main` (or `gh-pages`)
    - Select folder: `/ (root)`
    - Save settings
  - [x] Push to repository to trigger deployment
  - [x] Verify application is accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
  - [x] Confirm auto-deployment works by making a small change and pushing

- [x] Create/Update README.md (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add project title: "Sudoku Web App"
  - [x] Add description: Brief summary of the project (client-side Sudoku game)
  - [x] Add live demo link: The GitHub Pages URL
  - [x] Add technologies used: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
  - [x] (Optional) Add "Getting Started" section with local development instructions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Platform:** GitHub Pages (recommended)
- **Rationale:** Free static hosting, integrates directly with repository, automatic deployment on push
- **Alternative Options:** Netlify or Vercel (drag-and-drop deployment or git integration)
- **Configuration:** Deploy from repository root, no build process needed

**Repository Structure:**
```
sudoku-bmad/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── styles/
│   └── sudoku.css      # (Created in later story)
├── scripts/
│   ├── main.js         # (Created in later story)
│   ├── state.js        # (Created in later story)
│   ├── validation.js   # (Created in later story)
│   ├── generator.js    # (Created in later story)
│   └── ui.js           # (Created in later story)
├── docs/               # Already exists
│   ├── prd.md
│   └── architecture.md
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**HTML Structure for This Story:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Sudoku</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sudoku.css">
</head>
<body>
  <main class="app-container">
    <header class="app-header">
      <h1>Sudoku App</h1>
    </header>
  </main>

  <script type="module" src="scripts/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Important Notes:**
- **No build tools:** Deploy raw HTML/CSS/JS files directly
- **ES6 modules:** Use `type="module"` on script tag to enable native browser imports
- **Zero dependencies:** No package.json, no node_modules, no build process
- **GitHub Account Required:** User must have a GitHub account to configure GitHub Pages

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual verification in browser

**Test Checklist:**
1. Verify repository has correct folder structure
2. Check `.gitignore` excludes appropriate files
3. Open index.html locally in browser - should display "Sudoku App" heading
4. Visit deployed URL - should display the same content
5. Make a minor change to index.html, commit, push
6. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh deployed URL - should see the change

**Browser Compatibility:** Not critical for this story (just basic HTML), but test on Chrome for consistency
