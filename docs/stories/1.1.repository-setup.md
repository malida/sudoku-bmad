# Story 1.1: Repository Setup and Deployment Foundation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the project repository initialized with proper structure and deployed to static hosting,
**so that** I have a working deployment pipeline and can immediately see changes live.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Git repository is initialized with appropriate `.gitignore` for web projects
2. Repository contains initial folder structure: `/index.html`, `/styles/`, `/scripts/`, `/docs/`
3. Basic `index.html` exists with minimal content (e.g., "Sudoku App" heading)
4. Static hosting is configured on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
5. The application is accessible via public URL and displays the basic HTML page
6. Deployment automatically updates when changes are pushed to the repository
7. README.md contains the project name, description, and link to live deployment

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Git repository (AC: 1)
  - [x] Run `git init` if not already initialized
  - [x] Create `.gitignore` with entries for: `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `.env`, `*.log`

- [x] Create project folder structure (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create `/styles/` directory
  - [x] Create `/scripts/` directory
  - [x] Verify `/docs/` directory exists (should already contain PRD and Architecture)

- [x] Create basic index.html (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add DOCTYPE and HTML5 boilerplate
  - [x] Add `<head>` with charset, viewport meta tag, and title "Sudoku"
  - [x] Add basic structure: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<h1>Sudoku App</h1>`
  - [x] Link to `styles/sudoku.css` (file doesn't exist yet, that's okay)
  - [x] Link to `scripts/main.js` with `type="module"`

- [x] Configure static hosting (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Choose hosting platform: GitHub Pages (recommended)
  - [x] Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings:
    - Go to Settings → Pages
    - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
    - Select branch: `main` (or `gh-pages`)
    - Select folder: `/ (root)`
    - Save settings
  - [x] Push to repository to trigger deployment
  - [x] Verify application is accessible at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
  - [x] Confirm auto-deployment works by making a small change and pushing

- [x] Create/Update README.md (AC: 7)
  - [x] Add project title: "Sudoku Web App"
  - [x] Add description: Brief summary of the project (client-side Sudoku game)
  - [x] Add live demo link: The GitHub Pages URL
  - [x] Add technologies used: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
  - [x] (Optional) Add "Getting Started" section with local development instructions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Platform:** GitHub Pages (recommended)
- **Rationale:** Free static hosting, integrates directly with repository, automatic deployment on push
- **Alternative Options:** Netlify or Vercel (drag-and-drop deployment or git integration)
- **Configuration:** Deploy from repository root, no build process needed

**Repository Structure:**
```
sudoku-bmad/
├── index.html          # Main entry point
├── styles/
│   └── sudoku.css      # (Created in later story)
├── scripts/
│   ├── main.js         # (Created in later story)
│   ├── state.js        # (Created in later story)
│   ├── validation.js   # (Created in later story)
│   ├── generator.js    # (Created in later story)
│   └── ui.js           # (Created in later story)
├── docs/               # Already exists
│   ├── prd.md
│   └── architecture.md
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**HTML Structure for This Story:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Sudoku</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sudoku.css">
</head>
<body>
  <main class="app-container">
    <header class="app-header">
      <h1>Sudoku App</h1>
    </header>
  </main>

  <script type="module" src="scripts/main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Important Notes:**
- **No build tools:** Deploy raw HTML/CSS/JS files directly
- **ES6 modules:** Use `type="module"` on script tag to enable native browser imports
- **Zero dependencies:** No package.json, no node_modules, no build process
- **GitHub Account Required:** User must have a GitHub account to configure GitHub Pages

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual verification in browser

**Test Checklist:**
1. Verify repository has correct folder structure
2. Check `.gitignore` excludes appropriate files
3. Open index.html locally in browser - should display "Sudoku App" heading
4. Visit deployed URL - should display the same content
5. Make a minor change to index.html, commit, push
6. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh deployed URL - should see the change

**Browser Compatibility:** Not critical for this story (just basic HTML), but test on Chrome for consistency

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-24

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: EXCELLENT**

This foundational story has been implemented with high quality. The repository structure is clean, well-organized, and follows the architecture specification precisely. All deliverables meet their acceptance criteria.

**Key Strengths:**
- HTML5 structure is semantic and properly formed (index.html:1.1.repository-setup.md)
- README.md provides clear, comprehensive documentation with excellent getting started instructions
- .gitignore is thorough and includes appropriate exclusions for web projects
- Folder structure matches architecture specification exactly
- Deployment successfully completed to GitHub Pages

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: README.md
  - **Change**: Removed stale comment "(Update this link after GitHub Pages deployment)" from line 9
  - **Why**: The comment was outdated as deployment was already completed and verified
  - **How**: Improves documentation clarity by removing confusing placeholder text that suggested work was incomplete

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ HTML uses semantic tags (main, header, h1), proper DOCTYPE, and matches specification
- Project Structure: ✓ Matches source-tree.md exactly (index.html, styles/, scripts/, docs/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual verification approach appropriate for MVP per testing-strategy.md
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 - Git repository with .gitignore:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: .gitignore exists with all required entries (.DS_Store, node_modules/, .env, *.log) plus additional useful exclusions

**AC2 - Folder structure:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: Verified via directory listing - styles/, scripts/, docs/ all present at root level

**AC3 - Basic index.html:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: index.html contains proper HTML5 boilerplate, meta tags, semantic structure, "Sudoku App" heading (index.html:1-18)

**AC4 - Static hosting configured:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: Dev Agent Record documents GitHub Pages configuration completion

**AC5 - Public URL accessible:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: Live site at https://malida.github.io/sudoku-bmad/ per Dev Agent Record

**AC6 - Auto-deployment:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: Dev Agent Record states "Auto-deployment verified and working"

**AC7 - README.md complete:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: README.md contains project name, description, live demo link, technologies, getting started guide, project structure, and documentation links

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Removed stale deployment comment from README.md
- [ ] Consider removing package.json in future story (architectural concern - see below)

### Architectural Observation (Advisory)

**Pre-existing Condition (Not Story 1.1 Issue):**

A package.json file exists in the repository from the initial commit. According to docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, the project design specifies "Zero dependencies" and explicitly states "No package.json or package-lock.json (no npm)". The current package.json is minimal (no dependencies) but its presence contradicts the architectural principle.

**Impact:** Low - The file is benign (no dependencies) and doesn't affect functionality.

**Recommendation:** Consider removing package.json in a future cleanup story to align with architectural intent. This is advisory only and does not block Story 1.1 completion.

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security concerns identified. This story involves only static HTML and documentation files with no dynamic behavior, user input, or sensitive data handling.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT**

- index.html is minimal (~400 bytes) and loads instantly
- No external dependencies or resources
- Optimal for static hosting
- No performance concerns for this foundational setup

### Files Modified During Review

- README.md - Removed outdated deployment comment (1 line removed)

**Note to Dev:** Please update File List in Dev Agent Record section to include this QA modification when convenient.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-repository-setup.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria are fully met, code quality is excellent, and only minor documentation cleanup was performed. Story 1.1 successfully establishes the project foundation and deployment pipeline as intended.
