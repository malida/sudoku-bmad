# Story 2.3: Integrate Puzzle Generation with UI

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** Sudoku player,
**I want** new algorithmically generated puzzles when I click "New Puzzle",
**so that** I have unlimited unique puzzles to solve.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking "New Puzzle" triggers the puzzle generation algorithm
2. A loading indicator or message appears during generation (e.g., "Generating puzzle...")
3. The new generated puzzle replaces the current grid within 2 seconds
4. The grid displays the new puzzle's given clues with proper styling
5. All user entries from the previous puzzle are cleared
6. The newly generated puzzle is fully playable with all existing input and validation functionality
7. Each generated puzzle is different from the previous one (sufficient randomization)
8. If generation fails or times out, an error message is displayed and the user can retry
9. The hardcoded puzzles from Epic 1 are removed; the application now relies entirely on generation
10. The application loads with a freshly generated puzzle automatically on first visit

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update main.js to import generator module (AC: 1, 10)
  - [ ] Add import statement: `import * as generator from './generator.js';`
  - [ ] Verify generator module exports generatePuzzle() function

- [ ] Update handleNewPuzzle() function in main.js (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Show loading message before generation: `ui.showMessage("Generating puzzle...", "info");`
  - [ ] Wrap puzzle generation in try-catch block for error handling
  - [ ] Call `const newPuzzle = generator.generatePuzzle();` inside try block
  - [ ] Load new puzzle: `state.loadPuzzle(newPuzzle);`
  - [ ] Clear selection: `state.clearSelection();`
  - [ ] Clear UI selection: `ui.clearSelection();`
  - [ ] Re-render grid: `ui.renderGrid(state.getGrid(), state.getErrors(), state.getInitialGrid());`
  - [ ] Show success message: `ui.showMessage("New puzzle loaded!", "success");`
  - [ ] In catch block: display error message: `ui.showMessage("Puzzle generation failed. Please try again.", "error");`
  - [ ] Ensure error doesn't break application (user can retry)

- [ ] Implement loadPuzzleOnInit() helper function in main.js (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Create function that generates and loads initial puzzle
  - [ ] Show loading message: `ui.showMessage("Generating puzzle...", "info");`
  - [ ] Call generator.generatePuzzle()
  - [ ] Load puzzle using state.loadPuzzle()
  - [ ] Render grid using ui.renderGrid()
  - [ ] Hide message after successful load
  - [ ] Wrap in try-catch with error handling

- [ ] Update init() function to generate puzzle on load (AC: 10)
  - [ ] Remove any hardcoded puzzle loading from Story 1.5
  - [ ] Call loadPuzzleOnInit() after rendering initial grid structure
  - [ ] Ensure generation happens after DOM is ready
  - [ ] Keep existing event listener attachments

- [ ] Remove hardcoded puzzles from state.js (AC: 9)
  - [ ] Delete HARDCODED_PUZZLES array from state.js
  - [ ] Delete currentPuzzleIndex variable
  - [ ] Delete getNextPuzzle() function
  - [ ] Keep loadPuzzle() function (still needed for generated puzzles)
  - [ ] Remove initialization call to loadPuzzle() at end of state.js
  - [ ] Update state initialization to empty grid or defer until generation

- [ ] Update ui.js showMessage() for loading state (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Verify showMessage() supports "info" type for loading messages
  - [ ] Ensure message is visible during generation (not auto-hidden too quickly)
  - [ ] Consider adjusting auto-hide timing for loading messages vs success/error
  - [ ] Loading messages should persist until puzzle loads, not auto-hide after 3 seconds

- [ ] Test error handling and retry capability (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Simulate generation failure (temporarily modify generator to throw error)
  - [ ] Verify error message displays: "Puzzle generation failed. Please try again."
  - [ ] Verify New Puzzle button remains clickable (user can retry)
  - [ ] Verify error doesn't crash application
  - [ ] Restore normal generation after test

  - [ ] Test 10: Performance check - all generations complete < 2 seconds

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Depends on:**
- Story 2.2 (requires generatePuzzle() function)
- Story 1.5 (UI components: showMessage, renderGrid, buttons exist)

**Previous Story Insights:**

From Story 1.5:
- `handleNewPuzzle()` function exists in main.js
- Currently cycles through 3 hardcoded puzzles
- `state.loadPuzzle()` handles puzzle loading and state reset
- `ui.showMessage()` displays user feedback messages
- New Puzzle button event listener already attached

From Story 2.2:
- `generator.generatePuzzle()` creates valid puzzles with unique solutions
- Generation completes within 2 seconds
- Returns 9x9 grid with ~45 given clues

Story 2.3 replaces hardcoded puzzle cycling with algorithmic generation.

**File Locations:**
Modify existing files:
- `scripts/main.js` - Update handleNewPuzzle() and init()
- `scripts/state.js` - Remove hardcoded puzzles
- `scripts/ui.js` - Potentially adjust message timing
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#scripts-directory]

**Integration Approach:**

Current handleNewPuzzle() from Story 1.5:
```javascript
function handleNewPuzzle() {
  const newPuzzle = state.getNextPuzzle(); // OLD: cycles hardcoded
  state.loadPuzzle(newPuzzle);
  ui.clearSelection();
  ui.renderGrid(state.getGrid(), state.getErrors(), state.getInitialGrid());
  ui.showMessage("New puzzle loaded!", "info");
}
```

Updated handleNewPuzzle() for Story 2.3:
```javascript
function handleNewPuzzle() {
  ui.showMessage("Generating puzzle...", "info");

  try {
    const newPuzzle = generator.generatePuzzle(); // NEW: generate
    state.loadPuzzle(newPuzzle);
    state.clearSelection();
    ui.clearSelection();
    ui.renderGrid(state.getGrid(), state.getErrors(), state.getInitialGrid());
    ui.showMessage("New puzzle loaded!", "success");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Puzzle generation failed:", error);
    ui.showMessage("Puzzle generation failed. Please try again.", "error");
  }
}
```
[Source: architecture/module-interfaces-and-data-flow.md]

**Loading Message Strategy:**
- Show "Generating puzzle..." immediately when button clicked
- Keep message visible during generation (don't auto-hide)
- Replace with success or error message after generation completes
- Success message can auto-hide after 3 seconds (existing behavior)
- Error message should persist (user needs to see it)

**Initial Load on Page Visit:**
Add to init() function:
```javascript
function init() {
  // Existing: render grid structure, attach event listeners

  // NEW: Generate and load initial puzzle
  loadPuzzleOnInit();
}

function loadPuzzleOnInit() {
  ui.showMessage("Generating puzzle...", "info");

  try {
    const puzzle = generator.generatePuzzle();
    state.loadPuzzle(puzzle);
    ui.renderGrid(state.getGrid(), state.getErrors(), state.getInitialGrid());
    // Hide loading message after successful load
    setTimeout(() => ui.hideMessage(), 500);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Initial puzzle generation failed:", error);
    ui.showMessage("Failed to load puzzle. Click New Puzzle to try again.", "error");
  }
}
```

**State.js Cleanup:**
Remove from state.js:
- `HARDCODED_PUZZLES` array (3 puzzles from Story 1.5)
- `currentPuzzleIndex` variable
- `getNextPuzzle()` function
- Initialization call: `loadPuzzle(HARDCODED_PUZZLES[0]);`

Keep in state.js:
- `loadPuzzle(grid)` function (used by generator integration)
- All other state management functions

**Error Handling Strategy:**
Per coding standards, wrap generator calls in try-catch:
- Catch timeout errors from generator
- Catch any unexpected errors
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Keep application functional (don't crash)
- Allow user to retry by clicking New Puzzle again
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

**Performance Considerations:**
- Generation should complete within 2 seconds (NFR1)
- Loading message provides user feedback during wait
- If generation is slow, user sees "Generating puzzle..." message
- No need for Web Workers in MVP (generation is fast enough)
[Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]

**Testing Strategy:**
Manual testing per architecture:
- Verify loading indicator appears
- Verify generation completes within 2 seconds
- Verify variety (different puzzles each time)
- Verify error handling works (simulate failure)
- Verify initial page load generates puzzle
- Verify all game functionality works with generated puzzles
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Coding Standards:**
- Use try-catch for error handling
- Use console.error for logging errors (development only)
- Display user-friendly messages (not technical error details)
- Keep functions focused (separate loadPuzzleOnInit from init)
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual end-to-end testing of puzzle generation integration

**Manual Test Checklist:**

1. **Test New Puzzle Button Flow (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):**
   - Start application
   - Click "New Puzzle" button
   - Verify "Generating puzzle..." message appears immediately
   - Verify puzzle loads within 2 seconds
   - Verify loading message is replaced with "New puzzle loaded!" success message
   - Verify new puzzle displays in grid with given clues styled correctly (bold, gray)
   - Verify previous grid state is completely cleared
   - Click a cell and type a number - verify input works
   - Enter duplicate to create error - verify validation works
   - Click "Check Solution" - verify verification works

2. **Test Puzzle Variety (AC: 7):**
   - Click "New Puzzle" button
   - Take note of first row numbers
   - Click "New Puzzle" 4 more times (5 total)
   - Verify each puzzle shows different numbers in first row
   - Verify puzzles are visually distinct
   - Confirms randomization working

3. **Test State Clearing (AC: 5):**
   - Fill in several cells with numbers
   - Select a cell (should be highlighted)
   - Create an error (red highlighting)
   - Click "New Puzzle"
   - Verify all user entries gone (only given clues remain)
   - Verify no cell is selected
   - Verify no red error highlighting
   - Verify grid is clean slate

4. **Test Initial Page Load (AC: 10):**
   - Close and reopen browser tab (or hard refresh)
   - Verify "Generating puzzle..." message appears on load
   - Verify puzzle generates automatically
   - Verify no hardcoded puzzle displays
   - Verify generated puzzle is playable immediately
   - Repeat refresh 2-3 times - verify different puzzles each time

5. **Test Error Handling (AC: 8):**
   - Temporarily modify generator.js to throw error: `throw new Error("Test error");`
   - Click "New Puzzle" button
   - Verify error message displays: "Puzzle generation failed. Please try again."
   - Verify application doesn't crash (no console errors breaking app)
   - Verify New Puzzle button remains clickable
   - Click "New Puzzle" again - verify error persists (generator still broken)
   - Restore generator.js to working state
   - Click "New Puzzle" again - verify puzzle generates successfully
   - Confirms retry capability works

6. **Test Hardcoded Puzzle Removal (AC: 9):**
   - Open state.js file
   - Verify HARDCODED_PUZZLES array is deleted
   - Verify getNextPuzzle() function is deleted
   - Verify no initialization call to loadPuzzle(HARDCODED_PUZZLES[0])
   - Run application - verify no references to hardcoded puzzles in console
   - Confirms clean removal

7. **Performance Verification (AC: 3):**
   - Open browser DevTools Console
   - Add timing to handleNewPuzzle: `console.time("generation")` before generatePuzzle(), `console.timeEnd("generation")` after
   - Click "New Puzzle" 10 times
   - Verify each generation logs time < 2 seconds
   - Document results: "Min: 0.8s, Max: 1.6s, Avg: 1.2s"

8. **Integration Testing (AC: 6):**
   - Generate new puzzle
   - Test cell selection (click cells, verify highlight)
   - Test keyboard input (type 1-9, verify numbers appear)
   - Test validation (create duplicate, verify red highlighting)
   - Test "Check Solution" button (verify incomplete message)
   - Generate another new puzzle
   - Repeat tests - verify all functionality works
   - Confirms generated puzzles fully integrate with existing features

9. **Loading Message Timing:**
   - Click "New Puzzle"
   - Observe "Generating puzzle..." message
   - Verify it doesn't auto-hide before generation completes
   - Verify it's replaced by success message after generation
   - Verify success message auto-hides after 3 seconds (existing behavior)
   - Confirms message flow is smooth

**Expected Behaviors:**
- Loading message appears immediately when button clicked
- Puzzle generates within 2 seconds
- Success message appears after generation
- All user state cleared when new puzzle loads
- Generated puzzles are fully playable
- Error handling works gracefully
- Application never crashes
- Initial page load generates puzzle automatically

**Edge Cases to Test:**
- Multiple rapid clicks of "New Puzzle" button (should handle gracefully)
- Page refresh during generation (should start new generation)
- Generation error (should display error, allow retry)
