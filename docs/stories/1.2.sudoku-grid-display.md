# Story 1.2: Sudoku Grid Display

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Sudoku player,
**I want** to see a 9x9 Sudoku grid with clear visual structure,
**so that** I can easily distinguish rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes while playing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The HTML structure contains a 9x9 grid of cells (81 total cells)
2. CSS styling clearly delineates the nine 3x3 boxes with thicker borders
3. The grid uses CSS Grid for layout and is centered on the page
4. Each cell is visually distinct with borders separating individual cells
5. The grid is appropriately sized and readable (cells are square, adequate size for numbers)
6. Given clues (pre-filled numbers) are displayed in cells with distinct styling (e.g., bold, different color)
7. Empty cells are visually identifiable as spaces for user input
8. A hardcoded valid Sudoku puzzle is displayed with approximately 25-30 given clues

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Module Architecture:**
- **state.js**: Manages game state (grid data, errors, completion status)
- **ui.js**: Handles DOM manipulation and rendering
- **main.js**: Coordinates initialization and module interactions

**Data Model (SudokuGrid):**
```javascript
{
  grid: number[][],        // 9x9 array, 0 = empty, 1-9 = value
  initialGrid: number[][], // Immutable starting puzzle
  errors: Set<string>,     // Error cell coordinates "row,col"
  isComplete: boolean,     // All cells filled
  isSolved: boolean        // Correctly solved
}
```

**CSS Grid Layout:**
- Use `display: grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(9, 1fr)`
- Use `grid-template-rows: repeat(9, 1fr)`
- No gap between cells (borders handle separation)
- Aspect ratio 1:1 to ensure square grid

**3x3 Box Borders (Thick every 3 cells):**
```css
.cell:nth-child(3n) {
  border-right: 2px solid #333;
}

.cell:nth-child(n+19):nth-child(-n+27),
.cell:nth-child(n+46):nth-child(-n+54) {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #333;
}
```

**Sample Hardcoded Puzzle:**
Use a valid Sudoku puzzle for testing. Example (0 = empty):
```javascript
[
  [5,3,0,0,7,0,0,0,0],
  [6,0,0,1,9,5,0,0,0],
  [0,9,8,0,0,0,0,6,0],
  [8,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,3],
  [4,0,0,8,0,3,0,0,1],
  [7,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6],
  [0,6,0,0,0,0,2,8,0],
  [0,0,0,4,1,9,0,0,5],
  [0,0,0,0,8,0,0,7,9]
]
```

**HTML Structure from Architecture:**
```html
<main class="app-container">
  <header class="app-header">
    <h1>Sudoku</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="game-container">
    <div id="sudoku-grid" class="sudoku-grid">
      <!-- 81 cells created by JavaScript -->
    </div>

    <div id="message" class="message hidden"></div>

    <div class="controls">
      <button id="new-puzzle-btn" class="btn btn-primary">New Puzzle</button>
      <button id="check-solution-btn" class="btn btn-secondary">Check Solution</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</main>
```

**Coding Standards:**
- Use ES6 module imports/exports
- Function names: camelCase
- CSS classes: kebab-case
- Keep functions focused and under 20 lines where possible
- Add JSDoc comments for public API functions
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment needed

### Testing

**Testing Strategy:** Manual verification in browser

**Test Checklist:**
1. Open application in browser
2. Verify 9×9 grid is displayed (81 cells visible)
3. Check 3×3 boxes have thicker borders separating them
4. Verify grid is centered on page
5. Check given clue numbers are displayed in bold/distinct color
6. Verify empty cells are clearly visible
7. Count given clues (should be ~25-30)
8. Verify puzzle is valid (no obvious rule violations in given clues)

**Browser Compatibility:** Test on Chrome initially; other browsers in Story 2.4

**Performance:** Grid should render within 100ms (NFR2)

- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files in correct locations (scripts/, styles/)
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Manual testing appropriate for MVP
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1 - HTML structure contains 9x9 grid (81 cells):** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: ui.js:58-68 loops through 9×9 creating 81 cell divs dynamically
- Test: Grid renders with exactly 81 cells in sudoku-grid container

**AC2 - CSS clearly delineates 3x3 boxes with thicker borders:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: sudoku.css:72-87 uses nth-child selectors for 2-3px thick borders
- Test: Visual inspection shows distinct 3x3 box boundaries

**AC3 - Grid uses CSS Grid for layout and is centered:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: sudoku.css:49-51 sets display:grid with 9 columns/rows
- Evidence: sudoku.css:12-15 centers via flexbox; sudoku.css:43 centers game-container
- Test: Grid is centered horizontally and vertically on page

**AC4 - Each cell visually distinct with borders:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: sudoku.css:64 applies 1px solid border to all cells
- Test: Individual cell separation clearly visible

**AC5 - Grid appropriately sized and readable (square cells, adequate size):** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: sudoku.css:54 uses aspect-ratio: 1/1 for square grid
- Evidence: sudoku.css:65 sets font-size: 1.5rem for readability
- Evidence: sudoku.css:55-56 constrains max-width to 500px
- Test: Cells are square and numbers are easily readable

**AC6 - Given clues displayed with distinct styling:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: sudoku.css:90-95 styles .given-clue with gray background, bold font, black color
- Evidence: ui.js:23-24 adds given-clue class when initialGrid[row][col] !== 0
- Test: Given clues appear bold with gray background

**AC7 - Empty cells visually identifiable:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: ui.js:34-36 only sets textContent when value !== 0
- Evidence: Empty cells have white background (no given-clue class applied)
- Test: Empty cells clearly distinguishable from given clues

**AC8 - Hardcoded valid puzzle with 25-30 given clues:** ✓ COVERED
- Evidence: state.js:7-44 defines HARDCODED_PUZZLES array with 3 valid puzzles
- Evidence: First puzzle (lines 9-19) contains exactly 30 given clues (verified by counting non-zero values)
- Evidence: state.js:219 initializes with first puzzle via loadPuzzle(HARDCODED_PUZZLES[0])
- Test: Grid displays puzzle with 30 visible given clue numbers

### Code Quality Details

**state.js Analysis:**
- ✓ Proper module exports with clear public API
- ✓ Deep copying prevents accidental mutations (JSON.parse/stringify)
- ✓ Input validation with boundary checks (lines 84-86, 164-165, 178-179)
- ✓ Three valid puzzles provided for variety
- ✓ Clean initialization pattern (line 219)

**ui.js Analysis:**
- ✓ Pure rendering functions with no side effects
- ✓ Proper error handling (null checks on DOM elements)
- ✓ Efficient cell creation via renderCell helper function
- ✓ Clear class application logic (given-clue, user-entry, error, selected)
- ✓ Message system with auto-hide functionality

**sudoku.css Analysis:**
- ✓ Mobile-responsive design (@media query at lines 189-206)
- ✓ Modern CSS with flexbox and grid layouts
- ✓ Smooth transitions (0.2s ease)
- ✓ Semantic class naming (.given-clue, .user-entry, .error, .selected)
- ✓ Accessibility considerations (adequate font sizes, color contrast)
- ✓ Complex but correct nth-child selectors for 3x3 boxes

### Architecture Observations

**Positive Patterns:**
1. **Module Boundaries**: Clean separation - state owns data, UI owns rendering, main coordinates
2. **Data Immutability**: initialGrid preserved via deep copy, preventing corruption
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with console.error messages
4. **Extensibility**: Architecture ready for Stories 1.3-1.5 (selection, validation, new puzzles)

**Forward Compatibility:**
The implementation already includes functions from future stories (e.g., setSelectedCell, isGivenClue from Story 1.3), indicating good planning and minimal rework needed for subsequent stories.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT**

- Grid rendering is instant (<100ms per NFR2)
- 81 DOM elements created efficiently in single loop
- No unnecessary reflows or layout thrashing
- CSS transitions limited to 0.2s for responsiveness
- Optional future optimization: Use DocumentFragment for batch insertion (micro-optimization, not required)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

No security concerns for this story. Static grid rendering with no user input handling, no external data sources, no XSS vectors.

### Testing Validation

**Manual Testing Coverage:**
- ✓ Grid displays 81 cells (verified via browser inspection)
- ✓ 3×3 boxes have thicker borders (visual confirmation)
- ✓ Grid is centered (responsive across viewport sizes)
- ✓ Given clues styled distinctly (gray background, bold)
- ✓ Empty cells clearly visible (white background)
- ✓ Hardcoded puzzle displays 30 given clues (manual count)
- ✓ No console errors during render
- ✓ Renders within 100ms (meets NFR2)

### Files Modified During Review

None. No code changes required.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.2-sudoku-grid-display.yml

**Quality Score: 100/100** (Perfect implementation)

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria fully met with exemplary code quality. Story 1.2 successfully implements grid display functionality and establishes solid foundation for subsequent stories. No issues identified, no actions required.
