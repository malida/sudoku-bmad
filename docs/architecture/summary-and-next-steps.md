# Summary and Next Steps

## Architecture Summary

This architecture document defines a **simple, maintainable, and educational client-side Sudoku application** using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The design prioritizes:

✅ **Zero Dependencies:** No frameworks, libraries, or build tools
✅ **Zero Cost:** Static hosting on GitHub Pages (or Netlify/Vercel)
✅ **Clean Modularity:** Four focused modules (state, validation, generator, UI)
✅ **Clear Interfaces:** Well-defined public APIs and data flows
✅ **Performance:** Meets NFR1 (generation < 2s) and NFR2 (UI < 100ms)
✅ **Simplicity:** Straightforward implementation enabling AI-driven development

## Implementation Readiness

All requirements from the PRD are addressed:
- **13 Functional Requirements:** Mapped to specific modules and functions
- **8 Non-Functional Requirements:** Architectural decisions ensure compliance
- **9 User Stories:** Clear implementation path through Epic 1 → Epic 2

## Handoff to Development

**For AI Development Agent:**

You now have everything needed to implement the Sudoku application by following the PRD's story sequence (Story 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4). This architecture document provides:

1. **Module Structure:** Create the 5 JavaScript files (main.js, state.js, validation.js, generator.js, ui.js)
2. **Function Signatures:** Implement the public APIs documented in "Module Interfaces and Data Flow"
3. **Algorithm Guidance:** Use the pseudocode in "Algorithm Implementations" for solver/generator
4. **HTML/CSS:** Use the structures provided in "HTML Structure" and "CSS Architecture"
5. **Testing:** Verify against acceptance criteria in each story

**Start with Story 1.1:** Create the repository structure, basic HTML, and deploy to GitHub Pages. Then proceed sequentially through each story, using this document as the technical reference.
