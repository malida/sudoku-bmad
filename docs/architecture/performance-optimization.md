# Performance Optimization

## Performance Targets

**From PRD:**
- NFR1: Puzzle generation < 2 seconds
- NFR2: UI interactions < 100 milliseconds

## Optimization Strategies

**Puzzle Generation Performance:**
- Early termination in `countSolutions` after finding 2 solutions
- Limit cell removal attempts to reasonable threshold
- If generation consistently exceeds 2 seconds:
  - Increase target clues (45â†’50) for faster generation
  - Reduce uniqueness verification rigor (accept 1-2 solutions)
  - Post-MVP: Move generation to Web Worker (non-blocking)

**UI Performance:**
- CSS transitions limited to 150ms for smooth feel
- Event delegation minimizes event listener count
- Selective DOM updates (only re-render changed cells if needed)
- Avoid layout thrashing (batch DOM reads/writes)

**Load Time:**
- No external dependencies = minimal JS payload
- ES6 modules = native browser loading (no bundle parsing)
- Inline critical CSS or use single small CSS file
- Minimal HTML = fast initial parse

**Browser Caching:**
- Static files automatically cached by browser
- GitHub Pages sets appropriate cache headers
