# Security Considerations

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- **CSP Headers:** Not applicable for GitHub Pages (no control over headers); acceptable for MVP as no user data or sensitive operations
- **XSS Prevention:** No user-generated content rendered; numbers 0-9 only (no string injection risk)
- **Secure Storage:** No data stored; game state exists only in memory during session

**Authentication Security:**
- Not applicable (no authentication system)

**Data Privacy:**
- NFR8: No user data collection, storage, or transmission
- No cookies, no localStorage (for MVP), no analytics
- Complete user privacy by design

## Security Best Practices

- Input validation: Only accept numbers 1-9 (already constrained by game logic)
- No eval() or Function constructor usage
- No external script loading (no CDN dependencies)
- HTTPS enforced by GitHub Pages (automatic)
