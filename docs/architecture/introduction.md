# Introduction

This document outlines the complete technical architecture for the Sudoku Web App, a client-side only application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The architecture emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and educational value while delivering a fully functional Sudoku game with algorithmic puzzle generation.

This is a **greenfield project** with no starter templates or existing codebase. The architecture is designed from first principles to support zero-cost deployment, zero external dependencies, and straightforward AI-driven development.
